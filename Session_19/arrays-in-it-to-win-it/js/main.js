//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Movie 1", "Movie 2", "Movie 3"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let movie1 = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let movie_length = movies[0];
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let final_movie = movies[movies.length - 1];
